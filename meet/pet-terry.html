  <h2>Terry Journey</h2>
  <p>
Terry wasn‚Äôt always the cheerful ball of fur he is today. He was found curled beneath an old park bench, trembling, his big brown eyes watching the world with quiet hope. No one knew how long he had been alone ‚Äî just that he never barked, never begged. He simply waited.
  </p>
  <p>
When volunteers first approached him, he wagged his tail so gently it looked like a whisper in the wind. That was Terry: soft, patient, and endlessly forgiving.
  </p>
  <p>
In the shelter, he blossomed. He‚Äôd tilt his head when you spoke, as if he truly understood. He loved belly rubs, morning stretches in the sun, and licking peanut butter from a spoon. And oh ‚Äî the zoomies! For a little guy with short legs, Terry could fly.
  </p>
  <p>But what truly makes Terry special isn‚Äôt just his cuteness (which is off the charts). It‚Äôs the way he makes you feel like you‚Äôre the only human in the world. He leans into you during storms. He sits beside you when you‚Äôre sad. And when you come home ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs been ten minutes or ten hours ‚Äî he celebrates like you‚Äôre his whole universe.
Terry is ready now. Ready for a family who sees him not as a rescue, but as the rescuer of their hearts.
